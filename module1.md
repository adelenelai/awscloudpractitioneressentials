#### Client-server model
* metaphor of coffee shop, customers, employees
* virtual server: Amazon EC2; client: web browser or desktop application etc.
* instances on demand - "pay for what you need"
* client sends request to server -> server does work -> server sends response to client


#### Cloud computing
* on-demand IT resources with pay-as-you-go pricing
* undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT across vertical - what AWS offers (their services)
* 3 main deployment models for cloud computing
    - **cloud-based** e.g., virtual servers, dbs and networking components fully based on cloud
    - **on-premises** a.k.a. private cloud deployment e.g., virtualisation,application management
    - **hybrid** e.g., connect cloud based resources to legacy on-premises infrastructure
* benefits of cloud computing: low latency, flexibility, speed, pay as you go, stop guessing capacity, economies of scale
